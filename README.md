# KlebsiellaML
## This is a project on Machine Learning in R

## Info
This project will create a machine learning model to identify host-related biomarkers through k-mer representation and multi-label classification 
using data from the Klebsiella pneumoniae bacterium

It will be implemented in R

## Note
this is my first attempt at ML and R programming
